            Mizu works by continuously monitoring your daily activity and
            environment to help you stay hydrated and healthy. It tracks the
            number of steps you take throughout the day, analyzes the
            surrounding temperature, and uses this information to calculate how
            much water your body needs. Based on these factors, Mizu reminds you
            to drink at the right times, ensuring you maintain proper hydration
            whether you’re being active, working, or relaxing. It adapts to your
            lifestyle and conditions, helping you develop better hydration
            habits and overall well-being.

            When you stay properly hydrated and meet your daily water goals,
            Mizu rewards your consistency with a special collectible displayed
            on your screen. These collectibles serve as fun visual milestones
            that track your progress and motivate you to keep up your healthy
            habits. Each day you complete your hydration goals, you’ll receive a
            random collectible to add to your growing collection. Over time,
            your collection becomes a reflection of your dedication and
            progress, turning the simple act of drinking enough water into an
            engaging and rewarding experience.

            The device features two main buttons for easy control. The button on
            the left button is saying you drank, allowing Mizu to track when you
            have drank water. The button on the right is the revive button,
            which you press each time you forgot to drink water. This lets Mizu
            record your intake accurately and update your daily hydration
            progress in real time, ensuring your data stays consistent and
            personalized.
