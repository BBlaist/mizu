            <p>Our mission with "Mizu Companion" is to make self-care feel simple, kind, and genuinely enjoyable. We
                believe that taking care of yourself shouldn't feel like a checklist; it should feel like something that
                fits naturally into your day. By turning hydration into a gentle, interactive experience, we want to
                help people build healthier habits without stress or guilt.</p>

        <section class="why">
            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>We noticed something simple but important, most people don't drink enough water. Especially students.
                Between early classes, long study hours, and busy schedules, staying hydrated often gets forgotten. The
                result? Tiredness, headaches, trouble focusing, and feeling low on energy.
                We wanted to change that.
                That's why we decided to create the Mizu Companion: a smart, portable gadget designed to make drinking
                water effortless and fun. Our idea was to build something that fits naturally into daily life, not
                another app or reminder you'll end up ignoring.
                The Mizu Companion connects with a Mizu Band that you wrap around your bottle. Together, they
                automatically track when and how much you drink, no logging, no stress. The gadget can gently remind you
                to take a sip when you need it and help you stay consistent throughout the day.
                We chose to make this gadget because we believe small habits can make a big difference. By helping
                people especially students stay hydrated, we hope to boost focus, energy, and overall wellbeing in a
                simple, tech-friendly way.</p>

        <section class="how">
            <h2>How</h2>
            <p>Let's be real, between classes, study sessions, and late nights, it's way too easy to forget to drink
                water. Coffee? Sure. Energy drinks? Definitely. But water? Not so much.
                That's where the Mizu Companion comes in.
                It's your personal hydration sidekick, a small gadget you can take anywhere, that helps you stay on top
                of your water goals without even thinking about it.
                Here's how it works:
                You pop the Mizu Band on your water bottle.
                The Mizu Companion syncs with it and instantly knows when you take a sip.
                It keeps track of how much you've drunk and gives you a gentle nudge when it's time for more.
                No typing. No tracking apps. No forgetting.
                Whether you're in a lecture, at the gym, or pulling an all-nighter, the Mizu Companion makes sure you
                stay hydrated and feeling good. Because being a student is hard enough, drinking enough water shouldn't
                be.</p>
